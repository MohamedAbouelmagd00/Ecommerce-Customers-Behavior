Revealing hidden patterns in the data in order to be able to compete better and maximize profit in the face of intense competition in the market, and to establish value-oriented long-term relationships with customers, makes a great contribution to determining marketing strategies.\n","\n","However, the development of rule-based strategies is no longer possible in big data world, offering the right product to the right customer at the right time; it forms the basis of cross-selling and loyalty programs within the scope of customer retention and increasing lifetime value. Therefore, it has been crucial point for companies making product offers by using these patterns of association and developing effective marketing strategies Market Basket analysis is one of the association rule applications. It allows us to predict the products that customers tend to buy in the future by developing a pattern from their past behavior and habits.\n","\n","There are different algorithms to be used for Association Rules Learning. One of them is the Apriori algorithm. In this project, product association analysis will be handled with “Apriori Algorithm” and the most suitable product offers will be made for the customer who is in the sales process, using the sales data of an e-commerce company.\n","\n","How Apriori works ?\n","To construct association rules between elements or items, the algorithm considers 3 important factors which are, support, confidence and lift. Each of these factors is explained as follows:\n","\n","Support:\n","\n","The support of item I is defined as the ratio between the number of transactions containing the item I by the total number of transactions.\n","\n","Confidence:\n","\n","This is measured by the proportion of transactions with item I1, in which item I2 also appears. The confidence between two items I1 and I2, in a transaction is defined as the total number of transactions containing both items I1 and I2 divided by the total number of transactions containing I1.\n","\n","Lift:\n","\n","Lift is the ratio between the confidence and support.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"oDTBIOu8jqSc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# The mlxtend.frequent_patterns\n","Is a module provides a set of functions for generating frequent itemsets and association rules from transactional data using the Apriori algorithm. The main usage of this module is to identify the frequent itemsets in a transactional dataset, which are sets of items that appear together frequently in transactions. These frequent itemsets can then be used to generate association rules, which describe the relationships between different items in the
